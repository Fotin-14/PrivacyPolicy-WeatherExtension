    <p>
        This Chrome extension, <strong>"mini Weather Widget"</strong>, does not collect, store, or share any personal or sensitive user data.<br><br>
        All data used by the extension (e.g., selected city, widget position, widget state, and last-fetched weather info) is stored locally in the user's browser using <code>chrome.storage.local</code>.<br><br>
        No data is transmitted to any third parties for tracking or profiling purposes.<br><br>
        The extension may send requests to an external weather API server for the sole purpose of retrieving weather data, but it does not include any personally identifiable information.
